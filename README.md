# GB 760 Business Data Technologies
This Repository contains the final project submitted for GB 760.

# Course Description:
In this course, you will learn how to engineer and architect scalable, resilient, and extensible business data analytics pipelines with modern data management technologies. You will develop expertise in ingesting data from various sources, loading data into data lakes and warehouses, designing warehouse schemas, programmatically querying and analyzing warehoused data, and designing end-to-end data management architectures for both batch and streaming data.

# Project Overview:
https://emaadmanzoor.com/genbus760/f21/genbus760-f21-project.pdf
In this project, you will build a system to continuously score phrases and words based on their “trendiness” on Twitter. 
## Milestone 1: 
For this milestone, your code will simply read tweets from the Twitter API or a file and write them to a file on disk. You can think of this file on disk as your “data lake”.
## Milestone 2: 
For this milestone, you will transition your code to use a data warehouse (a PostgreSQL database) instead of a data lake. You will continue to read tweets from the Twitter API or a file, but will now write them to your database using Python.
## Milestone 3: 
For this milestone, you will extend your code to use a streaming message queue (Kafka).
