Here are some examples of potential failure:

  Example 1: API limit (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits). During this assigment I reached the limit and I had to wait 15min in order to run the code again to check if it works. 
  Example 2: network failure (see code for more details)
  Example 3: not enough space on the disc. Empty trash for more disc space or use another machine that has enough space to run the code.
